# Morse-Code-Translator-Automotive
Morse Code translator for automotive communication logic.
# 🏎️ Automotive Diagnostic Signal Simulator (Morse Logic)
**Author:** Kaushal  
**Focus:** Signal Encoding, ECU Diagnostics, Human-Machine Interface (HMI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool that translates standard text into Morse code and vice versa. While Morse code is a classic communication method, this project serves as a foundational study of **Pulse-Based Diagnostic Codes (Blink Codes)** used in automotive Electronic Control Units (ECUs).

## 🛠️ Why Automotive?
In automotive engineering, specifically in vehicle diagnostics, early systems used blinking light sequences (similar to Morse) to communicate fault codes to technicians. This project explores:
* **Signal Encoding:** Converting user input into binary-like pulses.
* **HMI Design:** Creating a clean interface for interaction between the user and the diagnostic logic.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensuring 100% accuracy in translation, critical for safety-related diagnostic data.

## 🚀 Features
* **Real-time GUI:** Built using Python's `Tkinter` for a professional desktop experience.
* **Dual Conversion:** Supports both Text-to-Morse and Morse-to-Text.
* **Clean Logic:** Optimized dictionary mapping for fast processing.

## 📂 How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Download `automotive_morse_app.py`.
3. Run the command: `python automotive_morse_app.py`

## 🎯 Career Goal
Currently a 12th-grade student aiming for a **Duales Studium in Germany** (Automotive Engineering). This project is part of my technical portfolio to bridge the gap between software logic and automotive systems.
